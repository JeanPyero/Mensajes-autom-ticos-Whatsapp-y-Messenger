## 2 codes that send automatic messages from python to whatsapp and messenger

Use these codes to send messages without opening your Whatsapp and Messenger accounts. 

Whatsapp allows you to send messages by configuring your own template, using its Test Number. If you want your number to appear as the one sending the message, you will have to pay $ 0.07 per message. It will not open your default browser.

Messenger will open when you execute the code, showing the chat with the person whose id you select, and sending the message automatically.
